# Testing

## Principles
- Test only the situations necessary to fully exercise all of the code’s behavior
- Sufficiently assert that the code does everything a new implementation would need to do


> This example demonstrates why strictly adhering to the “sufficient” rule by refusing to leave important behavior untested can be so valuable. If we’re ever tempted to skip testing some behavior, it’s probably because it’s hard to test, and the fact that it’s hard to test is probably because there are underlying design problems with the code. And there’s never be a better time to remediate a problematic design than before shipping it.
